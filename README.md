# Healthy-Habit-Tracker
In this application, we have started by creating a Login page for the user. When the user opens the app, it will be able to sign in directly, if it is already a registered member. 
If not, it will be able to create a new account by signing up. The details asked by the user will be Name, Mobile Number, password and email.
If in case, the user forgets the password, it will be able to go on the "forgot password" and enter the registered email address, through which the password will be reset.
